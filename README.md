# About the App

This is a full-stack app, that solves a big problem for many classroom K-8 teachers. At many schools, there is no school library. This forces classroom teachers to create a library in their classroom. This can be stressful to keep stocked with high level reading material. Often times the system to maintain a classroom library is trust. This app allows the classroom teacher to track who has which books, and for how long. It allows students to check out books.

# Technologies Used 

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, DaisyUI, tailwindcss, 

# Future add ons
When I improve this project, I want to use a search bar to add books to my classroom bookshelf. I would like to continue to add a "Hold" button that alerts kids when it's there turn to check out a book. I would like a feature for teachers to get all sorts of data around which books are popular, and who is doing the most reading.

# Lessons Learned
I learned about MVC, and how separating out concerns can really improve the organization of my code.
