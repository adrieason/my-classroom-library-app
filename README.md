# About the App

This is a full-stack app, that solves a big problem for many classroom K-8 teachers. At many schools, there is no school library. This forces classroom teachers to create a library in their classroom. It can be stressful to keep stocked with high level reading material. This app allows classroom teachers to upload there library inventory to a database, and it allows students to check out books.
