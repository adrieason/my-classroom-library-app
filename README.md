# About the App

This is a full-stack app, that solves a big problem for many classroom K-8 teachers. At many schools, there is no school library. This forces classroom teachers to create a library in their classroom. This can be stressful to keep stocked with high level reading material. Often times the system to maintain a classroom library is trust. This app allows the classroom teacher to track who has which books, and for how long. It allows students to check out books.
